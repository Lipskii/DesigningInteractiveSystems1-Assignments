Answers:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
		Yes, it was clear for the user. The user also really likes the solution.\\
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
		Not so much. The other parts are really possible, while VR goggles part was not realistic at all: the fighting with the other mascots is silly, not everyone wants that (might be hard for elderly). But fighting for right-earned food might also be fun for some.\\
		
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
		Yes, especially when he wants to find some obscure ingredient that he needs to complete a recipe. It is also better than asking some retail worker. He agreed that it might solve his problem.
\end{compactitem}

Transcript of the User Study (shortened):\\

\noindent Q: (the solution is explained) Can you take a look first? On the first box you can see a girl, this girl has a specific condition, ..., she has to find a specific product (pizza with no gluten), yet it does not have to be about just some health condition.  \\
A: It is pretty clear from the drawings and also after you explained. I think it is a quite nice solution.\\
Q: Do you find the solution realistic?\\
A: To be honest, the part about VR goggles are not really realistic, but the parts before are quite realistic and possible. \\
Q: Why do you think so?\\
A: The fighting with the other mascots are for me silly, people do not want to fight each time they go shopping. Also, not good for elderly, for example, and it seems kinda silly.\\
Q: Do you think that people would find this fun? Did you find this idea fun?\\
A: It could be fun, yeah. You can just get into the game (like role-playing) and in the end, you get your hard earned food, but I do not think it is a viable solution here.\\
Q: Do you have such a problem (of finding the right food)\\
A: (explains his experience, especially about specific recipes calling for specific ingredients) This kind of thing would help. So yes.

Answers:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
		Yes, only the game part is not very clear. How is he going to kill the other mascots was not clear. One other question was whether VR goggles are going to provided by the market.\\
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
	He is both concerned about the number of available screens in the market and who would provide the VR goggles. In short, he does not find it that much realistic.\\
	
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
		He thinks this would not solve his problems in its current form. He would like to have it in a way that more than one item is searchable via the application, so we would not spend so much time in front of the screen. However, he finds this promising.\\
		(he is also curious whether people would be concerned about gazes of others, as this application would be out in the open and everyone would see what he searched for)\\
		He said playing games in home and coming to fetch the coupons would be more fun!

	She believes that this could solve her problem, but something that would take her to the actual place might help better.\\

	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
	Much more realistic than the Solution \#1. Also, he finds this solution innovative to come up with.\\
	
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still

\end{compactitem}
\bigskip

\noindent Q: (solution explained) The storyboard is a bit obscure (the candidate agrees). You can choose a routing based on your preference. (...) In a time range, if the customer goes to the cash desk, with the mascot cherishing for you. Do you understand the solution?\\
A: Yes, quite clearly. (the user explains in a short manner)\\
Q: Do you find the solution realistic?\\
A: Yes, especially compared to the solution \#1. As long as the layout of the shop significantly changes, it is pretty innovative thing to come up with.\\
Q: Do you find the solution fun?\\
A: Yes, unlike the first one, it does not interfere with my shopping, and if I am fast enough, and with a coupon that is a positive feedback, that is actually pretty good.\\
Q: (some extra questions on usability)

	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
	Yes, user understands the solution and can explain the solution with his own words.
	\\
	
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
	Yes, but the user finds it not so viable for the supermarket, as supermarkets want the customers to spend more time inside, so the customers would buy more.
	\\
	
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
	Yes, the user agrees that this product would solve his problem, yet he is curious about the approaches of the supermarkets towards this product. Moreover, he does not want to be seen running around for coupons (it is explained that there would be time frame, so no early finishers would be gifted coupons)

\bigskip

\noindent Q: (solution explained as before) \\
A: (finds the mascot not decipherable, explains the solution in his words) \\
Q: Do you find the solution realistic?\\
A: Realistic, but one catch: there is a product like that. It is also counterproductive in the sense of supermarket, they want people to spend money. Good for the customer, not so good for the supermarket.\\
Q: Do you think that this solution can solve your problem?\\
A: Definitely. Would help me in my shopping, no doubt.\\
Q: Would it be more fun? \\
A: Nobody would like to look cheap running around (we explained that there would be a timeframe, not would be a race to go earlier)\\

	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
	I had to explain again what are AR glasses, on basic of VR glasses.\\

	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
	Yes, they are sure that when child will see his favorite character, will follow him. They restricted that probably it would have better feedback in bigger cities.\\
	Also, they mentioned about seeing in shopping malls a lot of children sitting in the cart with smartphone and watching some cartoon, and said that our solution is much better.\\
	Additionally I asked if they would pay for rent of glasses, they said yes, and compared this to shopping carts in shape of cars.\\

	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
	Only problem they see is accepting this solution by shopping malls. They also suggest way for convincing sellers to use our system - character that child sees could show parents some alternatives (f.e. family goes for cereals -> system suggests going to shelf with milk)\\

		The user did like the idea, especially since he is a marathon runner who needs to eat healthy. He felt that
it would decrease his time spent on daily routine of planning and buying healthy food. One curious observation he made was that many kids searching for a food 
in a store would create some chaos. Also, he noted, that there has to be huge amount of cartoons created in order to have one per every shopping.

\chapter{Our Evaluation}

\textbf{Pros \& Cons of Each Solution:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Solution \#1:
		\begin{compactitem}[*]
			\item (+) People are conscious about the ingredients (culture, preference, or a specific recipe calling for certain product), and this solution caters directly to this behavior.
			\item (-) Might not be helpful, and people prefer to be accompanied until the place of a product, just telling them "Aisle 10" might not help, as our user studies suggest.
			\item (-) Screen of big display allowing gazes of other passerby people might push people off from using this device, as suggested by our user studies.
		\end{compactitem}
	
	\item Solution \#2:
		\begin{compactitem}[*]
			\item (+) Directing people directly to the products one-by-one observed as something really enjoyable. One user off-record commented that they would really enjoy audial routing option, just like a robot being controlled.
			\item (-) Might not be wanted by the supermarkets, as supermarkets want people to stay as much as possible, so those people can spend more.
			\item (-) People might rush to the cash desks (this has been argued with users that there would be a time-frame, yet, this has been mentioned a lot, that is why this is added here).
			\item (+)The use of mascot is thought to be well-appreciated, and it can be customized based on the customer.
