User \#1:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Name: Hakan
	\item Information: age of 23, Turkish
	\item Profession: M.Sc. student
	\item likes to  play games and hang out with friends
	\item representative of our third persona (David)

Answers:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
		Yes, it was clear for the user. The user also really likes the solution.\\
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
		Not so much. The other parts are really possible, while VR goggles part was not realistic at all: the fighting with the other mascots is silly, not everyone wants that (might be hard for elderly). But fighting for right-earned food might also be fun for some.\\
		
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
		Yes, especially when he wants to find some obscure ingredient that he needs to complete a recipe. It is also better than asking some retail worker. He agreed that it might solve his problem.

User \#2:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Name: Furkan
	\item Information: age of 26, Turkish
	\item Profession: M.Sc. student
	\item interested in fitness, likes to learn about anything, joining online courses, gym-going, reading a lot
	\item representative of our first persona (Picky Eater Helga Ratt)
\end{compactitem}
\bigskip

Answers:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
		Yes, only the game part is not very clear. How is he going to kill the other mascots was not clear. One other question was whether VR goggles are going to provided by the market.\\
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
	He is both concerned about the number of available screens in the market and who would provide the VR goggles. In short, he does not find it that much realistic.\\
	
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
		He thinks this would not solve his problems in its current form. He would like to have it in a way that more than one item is searchable via the application, so we would not spend so much time in front of the screen. However, he finds this promising.\\
		(he is also curious whether people would be concerned about gazes of others, as this application would be out in the open and everyone would see what he searched for)\\
		He said playing games in home and coming to fetch the coupons would be more fun!

Answers:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
	Yes, it is quite clear. The user were able to explain the solution completely by putting himself in the shoes of the example in the storyboard.\\
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
	Much more realistic than the Solution \#1. Also, he finds this solution innovative to come up with.\\
	
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
	Yes, definitely. He also goes around the shop and got bored afterwards seeing all the same places, and this would really improve his experience.\\
