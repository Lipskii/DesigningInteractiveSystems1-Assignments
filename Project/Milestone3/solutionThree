Task 1)

Solution 3

a) Mother Persona
question a) Do you understand the solution?
- I general she understood the solution. The only one problem what made her confused was possibility to try different dishes. She described that storyboard shows "normal" size dish instead of little portion to try. I had to clarify that main idea is to get inspiration what to cook.

question b) Do the users find the solution realistic?
- She is around 40 years old and she is not technological geek. So didn't get valuable response. She just said "Yeah why not, that will be beneficial for users and supermarkets Such solution will definitely attract people."

question c) Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)?
- She really liked this solution. "I'm always tired and bored after 8 hours of work. Before relaxing in the front of TV i have to do everyday shopping.". The only one aspect what made her confused, was that even though after relaxing in the massage chair she has to cook at home. She said "What about - buying HEALTHY dishes in supermarket? I can imaging reading my favourite book in the store and someone else is preparing food for me. But it has to be healthy and well prepared. Then I will be able even to pay little bit more. Yeah that sounds better. I will pick what my family wants to eat and then I will have 30 min of relax."


b) Student Persona
question a) Do you understand the solution?
- He understood the solution, and he explained storyboard correctly. He had just one idea for improvement "I don't see sense of making
parallel stories. One story without your system and one with your system. I think better will be focus on yours system, and not show how ordinary shopping look - everyone know that."

question b) Do the users find the solution realistic?
- He was really pessimistic about the solution. He was complaining about the price and target users. "Firstly that will be extremely expensive to implement. Whole supermarkets will have to have 
larger dimensions.. System itself will be expensive. If you will provide 10 massage chairs. What about other people waiting for massage? Maybe better will be to called it "Massage and food" and provide something like restaurant. And skip the concept of implementing it in supermarkets."

question c) Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)?
- He said that it will be nice improvement in shopping. But as mentioned earlier - hard to implement. 

// to change
c) Picky Eater Persona
question a) Do you understand the solution?
- She understood the solution. She could explain storyboard step by step.

question b) Do the users find the solution realistic?

question c) Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)?
- She said that our solution will be helpful for her if - "You will serve products without gluten for me. Then I'll find solution to my problems with finding products in supermarkets"


Pro argument:
- Supermarkets will have larger group of trusted customers. People who will find shopping more fun, not just everyday duty.

Con argument:
- Our solution will be extremely expensive to implement. We'll need:
    - space in supermarkets for our chairs. Probably that will have to be included in architect projects. -> that will cause extra fees,
    - supermarkets will need to hire extra employees - chefs to preparing dishes. That will cause another demand - kitchen in the supermarket.
