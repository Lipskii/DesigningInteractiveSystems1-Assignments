\endgroup
				\vspace{-0.5cm}
				\textbf{Problem Statement:} People spending too much time deciding on what to buy for their refrigerators \& what to cook using the ingredients in the said refrigerator. Moreover, they get frustrated or bored because they spend so much time \& got a little gain from their spent time and effort.\\

	\section{Possible Six Solutions}
	
		\subsection{Solution \#1}
		
			\textbf{Definition:}\\
			\indent Informative screen in supermarkets that can be used for searching items with certain ingredients.\\
			
			\noindent \textbf{Use Case:}\\
			\indent The persona \textit{Picky Eater Helga Ratt} has a condition preventing her from eating gluten, and she cannot easily eat out as cheap places do not offer information about all the contents of a food, so she has to buy her products. If she wants to try something new that she did not eat before, she has to check the ingredients and read all the notifications on a packaging in order to see whether she can consume; and she dreads this as she lusts for some products but the time required is comparably abysmal to the pleasure of that food would bring.\\
			
			Market Helper! comes into play here. She can search for `Pizza` which contains `NO` amount of `gluten`, and Market Helper! would inform her about the whereabouts of the products that fits the criteria, saving Frau Ratt time. The screens can be installed to the supermarkets in couples, as each user would assumably take 5 minutes on the screen at most.\\

		\clearpage
		\subsection{Solution \#2}
		
			\noindent \textbf{Definition:}\\
			shopping assistants for supermarkets, which is placed on the handle of a shopping cart in the form of a smart tablet\\
			
			\noindent \textbf{Use Case:}\\
			Fulfilling a complete shopping list takes time, especially if users are not so aware of the layout a specific supermarket and whereabouts of the products that are needed. Asking to the employees not always help, as they are not always around or they just verbally inform once.\\
			
			Shopping List Helper! comes into play here. One can create a shopping list on the said tablet on the spot, or one can synchronize their shopping list at their phone via NFC. Then, SLH would lead the user via the shortest path either using a map of the supermarket together with the marker for the user, or via audial cues that are continuously feeded to the headphones of the user.\\
