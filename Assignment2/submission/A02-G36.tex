\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Good}\\
	\hline
	\textbf{{[Law 1 (Good Shape)]:}} figure \textbf{Gmail:A} has a shape of oval, which has a simple curvature, and thus, easy to remember.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{{[Law 2 (Proximity)]:}} \textbf{figure PaulGraham:B} shows three images listed side-by-side. They are close to each other, and thus, are perceived as belonging together, which is the case. A good example for a badly-designed website.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{{[Law 3 (Closure)]:}} \textbf{figure Gmail:C} shows that although not explicitly, the navigation bar on the left side is "hiddenly" closed. There is no visible line dividing this bar and the rest of the webpage, but those navigation buttons for different e-mail categories are perceived to be closed in a rectangular shape.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{{[Law 4 (Similarity)]:}} \textbf{figure PaulGraham:A} shows that the navigation button on the left are of the same size, shape, and color. This leads to a less information content, which requires less effort from the users.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{{[Law 6 (Experience)]:}} \textbf{figure Gmail:D} makes use of two commonly used symbols, which even could be called universally acknowledged ones, one for "Social" segment (two people, one in front of the other), and one for "Promotions" segment (discount tag).\\
	\hline

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Symptom}\\
%	\hline
%	\textbf{{[Law 6 (Experience)]:}} \textbf{PaulGraham:A} and \textbf{PaulGraham:C} indicates that the navigation bar on the left is inconsistent. While homepage has missing "Home" button, "Essays" page has missing button of "Email". This inconsistency  \\
	\hline
	\textbf{{[Law 6 (Experience)]:}} \textbf{Blinkee:C} pressing cross button on the "Need Help" sign does not close the "Chat with Matt" part, it stays still. In this perspective, a user expects the duty of cross button to be to close the related part, which is not the case here.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{{[Law 2 (Proximity)]:}} \textbf{Blinkee:A} Cart tab and Cart sign both direct to the same URL, yet they are not packed or placed together, making the interface un-simple (if such a word exists). \\
	\hline
	\textbf{{[Law 3 (Closure)]:}} \textbf{Blinkee:B} the objects sold have no closure at all. While overdone closures are repulsive, having none in this case does make it harder to connect objects with their properties such as the prices and the buttons. \\
	\hline
	\textbf{{[Law 1 (Good Shape)]:}} \textbf{Blinkee:B} makes use of no shapes, no boundaries in any of the DOM of the website. Not exploiting the cognitive compression, not in a slightest bit is a bad design. \\
	\hline
	\textbf{{[Law 4 (Similarity)]:}} \textbf{Blinkee:C} topmost center buttons having no similarity (they having no indicative boundary too) does NOT help observing them as a group; they appear as individual parts while they are actually a part of navigation bar to help user traverse the website. This is not a good design.\\
	\hline

\textbf{Visibility}:\\


\textbf{Perceived affordance}: checkboxes in \textbf{Gmail:B} conveys the idea that I can interact with them to select multiple e-mails and operate on them at once.\\

\textbf{False affordance}: Logout button available although no login has been done \& Checkout button available although no item in the cart (in the Blinkee website).\\



\textbf{Intentional signifier}: + sign in "+ Compose" button at the top left of  \textbf{Gmail:A} is a signifier. (although we have a distinct button for Compose, + sign is one of the few colored items in this webpage, and + sign signifies that I can create something, thus, and intentional signifier gathering attendance to its place)\\

\textbf{Misleading signifier}: rating box in bottom left of the website, pointing that one can assign points directly from this box, yet star-slider not being clickable (no response).
